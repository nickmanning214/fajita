# ðŸŒ® Fajita
A custom extension of Backbone.js, providing deep models, directives, and other features.

## Overview

The vision behind Fajita is to provide an efficent way to connect a view to a model, and have the view automatically update when changes to a model occur.

## Fajita.Model

`Fajita.Model` is a `Backbone.Model` that is built for having application structure. 
There is no built-in way to provide nested model structure with Backbone.Model.
Providing this kind of functionality is left as an exercise for the developer.
The reason for this is because one valid pattern of organizing models is join them by id's. 
This approach makes it easier to maintain a flat model which is easy to save and load models to/from a SQL database.

Symantically speaking, it doesn't seem right to treat models as flat just because that's logistically how it would work on the backend.
Then again, managing a deep model would be difficult to maintain when saving and loading across a server to a SQL database.

Fajita.Model is a simple solution to this problem. The structure of models is maintained in the model by reference (not by relationships or joins). 
However it is done without interfering with a flat attributes object that can be easily loaded and saved.
